<div style="margin-left: 40px;">a. licence grant.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">1. Sharing Fan Works.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the SOUL, the Creator hereby
grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive,
irrevocable licence to exercise the Licenced Rights in the Original
Work to produce, reproduce, and Share Fan Work.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">A. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Creator does not grant You the right to Share the Original
Work, in whole or in part.<br>
</div>
2. Using Identifying Elements. Subject to the terms and conditions of
the SOUL, the Creator hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable licence to utilize the
Identifying Elements in the Original Work in the process of exercising
your Licenced Rights to Share Fan Work, subject to Section 2(a)(7).<br>
3. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, the SOUL does not apply,
and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.<br>
4. Term. The term of the SOUL is specified in Section 5(a).<br>
5. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Creator
authorizes You to exercise the Licenced Rights in all media and formats
whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical
modifications necessary to do so. The Creator waives and/or agrees not
to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical
modifications necessary to exercise the Licenced Rights, including
technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological
Measures. For purposes of the SOUL, simply making modifications
authorized by this Section 2(a)(5) never produces Fan Work.<br>

&#8211; Original Work. Every recipient of the Original Work automatically
receives an offer from the Creator to exercise the Licenced Rights
under the terms and conditions of the SOUL.<br>

Work from You automatically receives an offer from the Creator to
exercise the Licenced Rights in the Fan Work under the conditions of
the version of the SOUL You apply to the Fan Work.<br>
C. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any
additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective
Technological Measures to, the Original Work if doing so restricts
exercise of the Licenced Rights by any recipient of the Original Work.<br>
</div>
7. No endorsement. Nothing in the SOUL constitutes or may be construed
as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the
Original Work is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted
official status by, the Creator or others designated to receive
attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).<br>
</div>
b. Other rights.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">1. Moral rights, such as
the right of integrity, are not licenced under the SOUL, nor are
publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however,
to the extent possible, the Creator waives and/or agrees not to assert
any such rights held by the Creator to the limited extent necessary to
allow You to exercise the Licenced Rights, but not otherwise.<br>
2. Patent and trademark rights are not licenced under the SOUL, except
as stated in Section 2(a)(2).<br>
3. To the extent possible, the Creator waives any right to collect
royalties from You for the exercise of the Licenced Rights, whether
directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or
waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases
the Creator expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.<br>

limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a
particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other

You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or
otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential,
punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages
arising out of the SOUL or use of the Original Work, even if the

expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in
full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.<br>

Your discovery of the violation; or<br>

</div>

the Creator may have to seek remedies for Your violations of the SOUL.<br>
c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Creator may also offer the Original
Work under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the
Original Work at any time; however, doing so will not terminate the

<h2>Section 7 &#8211; Interpretation.</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">a. For the avoidance of
doubt, the SOUL does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce,
limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Original Work
that could lawfully be made without permission under the SOUL.<br>

unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent
necessary to make it enforceable, taking into account Creator's
Statement of Purpose. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be
severed from the SOUL without affecting the enforceability of the
remaining terms and conditions.<br>
c. No term or condition of the SOUL will be waived and no failure to
comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Creator.<br>
d. Nothing in the SOUL constitutes or may be interpreted as a
limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply
to the Creator or You, including from the legal processes of any
jurisdiction or authority.<br>
