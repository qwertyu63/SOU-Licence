The <a href="licence.html">Shared Open Universe Licence</a>
is a public licence, allowing fan
works to be created and shared freely and contributing to the <a href="list.html">Open Universe</a>, a pool of settings
which anyone can use, allowing fans and the original creator to build
on each other's work.<br>
