is an public licence, allowing fan
works to be created and shared freely and contributing to the <a href="list.html">Open Universe</a>, a pool of settings
which anyone can use, allowing fans and the original creator to build
on each other's work.<br>
<h2>Basic Terms:</h2>
If a work is released under the&nbsp;Shared Open Universe Licence,
you are permitted to:<br>
<ul>
<li>Create fan works derived from it and;</li>
<li>Share those fan works in any way you see fit, even
commercially.</li>
</ul>
